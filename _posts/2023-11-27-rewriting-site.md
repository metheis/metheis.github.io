## Hi There!

I decided to change up my site! Thus far, I have the Jekyll framework up and running, customized to my liking through the Chirpy theme. I have also filled in the About page (left sidebar!), and will soon port over former blog posts (https://marks.page/blog) to this site!

Much more to come.
