I recently ordered more loose leaf tea from Harney & Sons! The varieties I chose for this round were:

 - Organic Gunpowder Green Tea
 - Chamomile
 - Decaf Ceylon
 - Decaf Vanilla Comoro
 - Organic Breakfast Tea
 - Organic Darjeeling
 - Organic Assam
 - Organic Rooibos
 - Organic Everyday Matcha
 - Organic Rooibos Chai

I also reloaded organic sencha and jasmine green teas!

My favorite of the black teas is the Assam variety.

Lastly, I recently visited the Harney store in SOHO. I tried a cup of their Pumkin Spice tea: it had just the right amount of spice! I should remain careful that my eyes don't turn blue. And of course, one cup of their organic sencha for takeaway (my overall favorite).
