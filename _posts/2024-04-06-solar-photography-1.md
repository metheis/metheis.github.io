Pressing on (a test of resiliency ðŸ™ƒ)

In preparation for the total solar eclipse that will pass over much of the continental United States on April 8, I ordered a solar filter for my camera. I took a couple of test shots. The one above is of just the sun (no way, really??), and in the one below, I also managed to capture a sun spot while it was present on the sun's surface.

The weather forecast for Monday does not appear promising (I will observe from Austin, TX), but there is a chance for some clarity, and if not, hopefully the darkness effect will be unique and amazing to experience.
