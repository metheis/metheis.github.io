One of my Covid projects was to compile all of the quotes that appear at the beginning of The Clone Wars episodes (I often appreciated the lesson and meaning associated with each one when I watched the series growing up). I forgot about it for a while.

I originally utilized a raw html design from HTML5UP, but at the end of the day it was not particularly pretty, and there was more work to upkeep html directly. I decided to move it over to Jekyll, which makes it much easier to modify and maintain as I write the content in Markdown. The minimal design also better fits the content.
