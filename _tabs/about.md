Hi üëãüèΩ, thanks for stopping by! I'm a network software engineer at SpaceX where I work on the Starlink satellite Internet constellation! I'm on the laser topology team, and work closely with the laser mesh routing team. I recently finished graduate school at UC Berkeley where I was advised by Scott Shenker in the NetSys Lab. I find interest in many facets of high tech, but have a particular curiosity when it comes to computer networks and hardware, operating systems, and network security. Non-academically, I have find an interest in cars, especially with the new and more sustainable approaches many manufacturers are picking up today, and hobby photography. If I'm not building my next project, you can probably find me hiking or climbing!
